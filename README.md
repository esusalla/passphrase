This is a clone of the popular [Catch Phrase party game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch_Phrase_(game)) that I made to play remotely with friends during the 2020 lockdowns.

I never finished fully styling everything, but it was fun to work on and worked well enough to play a few games together.
